This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

12.1.1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
magnets <- read_csv("magnets.csv") |>
    mutate(active=as.factor(active))
```
Null: X(control_after) = X(control_before)
Alt: X(control_after) > X(control_before)

12.1.2

See above.

12.1.3

Okay, apparently we can plug everything into a t.test.


```{r}
# so, we need count and var of change grouped by active

change <- magnets |>
    filter(active=='"2"') |>
    pull(change)

t.test(change, mu=0)
```
13.1.1
Comparison of pain before
```{r}
control_before <- magnets |>
    filter(active=='"2"') |>
    pull(score1)

treat_before <- magnets |>
    filter(active=='"1"') |>
    pull(score1)

t.test(control_before, treat_before, mu=0)
```
Not rejecting

13.1.2

```{r}
var.test(control_before, treat_before, ratio=1)
```
Not rejecting

13.1.3-4
```{r}
control_after <- magnets |>
    filter(active=='"2"') |>
    pull(score2)

treat_after <- magnets |>
    filter(active=='"1"') |>
    pull(score2)

t.test(control_after, treat_after, mu=0)
var.test(control_after, treat_after, ratio=1)
```
Reject null for both

5.20

```{r}
height_R = 0.67
height_b1 <-9.41 * height_R / 10.37
height_b0 <- height_b1 * -108.2 + 171.14
height_R2 <- height_R^2

linear_model <- function(girth) {
    height_b1 * girth + height_b0
}

sample_pred <- linear_model(100)

resid <- 160 - sample_pred
```

6 centimeters shorter than predicted

f) No, because children have different proportions, and this model wasn't trained on them.

5.29

Positive correlation between height and weight

```{r}
model_weight <- function(height) {
    -105.0113 + 1.0176 * height
}
```

So, you gain about a kilogram for each centimeter of height, and the model breaks down for midgets.

p-value is 0, so definitely correlation.

```{r}
0.72^2
```
R^2 means that your height predicts about half of your weight. The other half would come from factors such as genetics, diet, exercise, etc.

```{r}
library(modelr)

height_stats <- read.table('body.dat.txt') |> 
    rename(height=V24, weight=V23)

height_line <- lm(weight ~ height + 1, height_stats)
summary(height_line)

height_stats |>
    data_grid(height) |>
    add_predictions(height_line) |>
    ggplot(aes(x=height, y=pred)) +
    geom_line()

height_stats |>
    ggplot(aes(x=height, y=weight)) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.1)

height_stats |>
    add_predictions(height_line) |>
    ggplot(aes(x=height, y=pred)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(aes(y=weight), alpha=0.2, size=4)

```
6.1
```{r}
baby_data <- read.table("babyweights.txt")
smoke_line <- lm(bwt ~ smoke, baby_data)
summary(smoke_line)
```
Babies with smokers have a weight of 114. Without it, they have 123. This is definitely statistically significant.

```{r}
parity_line <- lm(bwt ~ parity, baby_data)
summary(parity_line)
```
It seems that firstborns have an average weight of 120, while later children have an average weight of 118. But this is not statistically significant.

```{r}
baby_line <- lm(bwt ~ parity + smoke + age + gestation + height + weight, baby_data)
summary(baby_line)
```
It seems that the longer you gestate, the heavier the baby, which is completely shocking.
While older mothers make very slightly lighter babies, but the latter isn't significant.

It seems that parity matters only in relationship to other variables, but if you can't first split on those, it means nothing.

```{r}
120 - predict(baby_line, baby_data |>
                  slice_head(n=1))

```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
