This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

This is for doing normal stuff.

```{r}
pop2 <- read_csv("pop2.csv")
n_samples <- 150
```

```{r}
pop2 |>
    summarize(mean_bmi=mean(bmi), sd_bmi=sd(bmi))
```

```{r}
find_sample <- function(n) {
    sample <- pop2 |>
        slice_sample(n=n_samples) |>
        summarize(sample_mean=mean(bmi))
    sample$sample_mean
}

many_means = replicate(10^4, find_sample(n_samples))

sample_mean = mean(many_means)
sample_sd = sd(many_means)

sample_mean
sample_sd

quantile(many_means, c(0.1, 0.9))

c(qnorm(0.1, sample_mean, sample_sd), qnorm(0.9, sample_mean, sample_sd))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
